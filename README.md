Corgis are the eevees of the dog world.  When they have puppies with any other dog breed, their puppies become an adorable corgi version of the other dog.  In order to see what my corgi would look like as a golden retriever mix, I used artificial intelligence (more specifically deep learning, more more specifically CycleGANs).

Most of my code for this project are relatively minor modifications built on these two repositories:

CycleGANs: https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
Corgi StyleGAN: https://github.com/seawee1/Did-Somebody-Say-Corgi

Visualizations of corgi to golden cyclegan.  Click on the top row of images to choose a new one.  Then the center image is the original and the bottom row are the transformations where the leftmost is earlist and rightmost is latest.

* [corgi.html](https://hughchen.github.io/corgi2golden/corgi.html) contains the corgi to golden transformations.  
* [golden.html](https://hughchen.github.io/corgi2golden/golden.html) we have the golden to corgi transformations.
